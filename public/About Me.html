<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>My name is Melika Bagheri, and I am a 21-year-old Iranian girl from Tehran. I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science at Guilan University, where I am passionate about exploring the vast and ever-evolving world of technology. Growing up in
    Tehran, a city known for its rich culture and innovation, has inspired me to embrace both creativity and logic, which I now channel into my academic and professional pursuits.</p>

<p>As a web developer, I have found my calling in creating dynamic and user-friendly websites that solve real-world problems. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into functional digital experiences, whether it's through coding, designing, or optimizing
    web applications. My journey in computer science has equipped me with skills in programming languages, web development frameworks, and problem-solving, which I continuously strive to improve through hands-on projects and learning.</p>

<p>Beyond my technical skills, I am deeply curious about the intersection of technology and human interaction. I believe that the digital world has the power to connect people and transform lives, and I am committed to contributing to this field with innovation
    and dedication. As I continue my studies and grow as a developer, I aim to use my knowledge to create meaningful solutions and inspire others, especially young women, to pursue their passions in STEM fields.</p>
